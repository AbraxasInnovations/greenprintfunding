# ABRAXAS GREENPRINT FUNDING BOT - REFUND POLICY

**Last Updated: 02/20/2025**

This Refund Policy ("Policy") outlines the terms and conditions regarding refunds for subscriptions to Abraxas Greenprint Funding Bot ("Service"). By subscribing to our Service, you acknowledge and agree to this Policy.

## 1. NO REFUND POLICY

### 1.1 Non-Refundable Subscriptions
All subscription payments for the Service are **non-refundable**. Due to the nature of digital services and the immediate access to our proprietary technology platform, we maintain a strict no-refund policy for all subscription tiers.

### 1.2 Subscription Cancellation
You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting our support team. Upon cancellation:
- Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period
- No partial refunds will be issued for unused portions of the current billing period
- Automatic renewal will be disabled for future billing cycles

### 1.3 Rationale for No-Refund Policy
Our strict no-refund policy is based on the following considerations:
- Immediate access to proprietary digital market analysis tools
- Continuous real-time data processing and computational resources allocated upon subscription
- Operational costs incurred regardless of individual usage patterns

## 2. EXCEPTIONS

### 2.1 Service Unavailability
In the rare event that our Service is completely unavailable for a continuous period exceeding 72 hours due solely to our technical failures (and not due to external factors, third-party integrations, or scheduled maintenance), we may consider, at our sole discretion, providing service credits for future use.

### 2.2 Unauthorized Charges
If you believe your account has been charged without authorization, please contact our support team immediately. With proper verification, we will investigate unauthorized payment claims in accordance with Paddle's payment dispute procedures.

## 3. SUBSCRIPTION TIER CHANGES

### 3.1 Upgrading
When upgrading from a lower to a higher subscription tier, the new tier will be activated immediately. The remaining value of your current subscription will be prorated and applied as a credit toward the higher tier.

### 3.2 Downgrading
When downgrading from a higher to a lower subscription tier, the lower tier will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle. No refunds will be issued for the difference in price for the current billing period.

## 4. FREE TRIAL PERIODS

If we offer free trial periods, no payment will be required during the trial. Upon trial expiration, your selected subscription will activate and billing will commence automatically unless you cancel before the trial period ends.

## 5. PAYMENT DISPUTES AND CHARGEBACKS

Initiating payment disputes or chargebacks with your payment provider instead of contacting us directly may result in the immediate termination of your account and access to the Service.

## 6. MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY

We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to our website. It is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically.

## 7. CONTACT INFORMATION

If you have questions about this Refund Policy or need to discuss exceptional circumstances, please contact our support team at [Support Email].

By subscribing to our Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Refund Policy.
